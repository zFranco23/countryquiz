## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/zFranco23/countryquiz/blob/main/public/countryImage.png)

Hi ðŸ‘‹, you can see the demo in : https://zfranco23.github.io/countryquiz/ .
This is my solution for the challenge proposed in [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) .
First I had to divide the whole problem in small problems that would help to us to complete the goal.

- Use React Hooks to have a better perfomance in our application , I used useEffect to call the [REST countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API to fetch the countries and useState to share the response.
- I improved my knowledge about React and Material UI.
